## Documentation of `pom.xml`

This `pom.xml` file defines the build configuration for a Maven project named "kafka-project". 

**Overview:**

The `pom.xml` file specifies the project's structure, dependencies, and build process. It uses the Apache Maven framework to manage the project's lifecycle, including compiling, testing, and packaging. 

This particular project appears to be focused on interacting with Apache Kafka, as evidenced by the inclusion of Kafka dependencies. 

**Dependencies:**

* **junit:** Used for testing the project's functionality.
* **com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:**  Likely used for serializing and deserializing data, potentially for communication with Kafka.
* **org.apache.kafka:kafka_2.12:**  The core Kafka library.
* **org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients:**  Provides client libraries for interacting with Kafka.

**Build Configuration:**

* **maven-assembly-plugin:** This plugin creates a distributable archive (JAR) containing the project's compiled code and its dependencies.
* **maven-compiler-plugin:** Configures the Java compiler to use Java 8 source and target versions.

**Pseudo Code:**

The provided code snippet is a partial example demonstrating Kafka interaction, not part of the `pom.xml` file itself. 

**Pseudo Code for Kafka Interaction:**

```
// Start Kafka Consumer
consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(KafkaProperties.get())
consumer.subscribe(topics)

// Continuously consume messages
while (true) {
    consumerRecords = consumer.poll(100) // Poll for new messages

    // Handle empty records
    if (consumerRecords.count() == 0) {
        noRecordsCount++
        if (noRecordsCount > giveUp) {
            break; // Stop consuming
        } else {
            continue; // Wait for next poll
        }
    }

    // Process each received record
    for each record in consumerRecords:
        print record details (key, value, partition, offset)
        // Process the record's value (e.g., deserialize, use data)

    consumer.commitAsync() // Commit offset to acknowledge message processing
}

// Stop Kafka Consumer
consumer.close()

```


**Note:** The pseudo code provided is a simplified representation and does not include error handling or specific implementation details. 


**Dependencies and Libraries:**

* **Java:** The project is written in Java and relies on the standard Java libraries.
* **Maven:** Used for project management and dependency resolution.
* **Apache Kafka:** The core library for interacting with Kafka. The `kafka_2.12` and `kafka-clients` dependencies provide the necessary tools for producing and consuming messages.
* **JUnit:**  A testing framework for Java used to write and execute tests for the project.
* **Jackson:** A library for JSON processing, likely used for serializing and deserializing data exchanged with Kafka.
